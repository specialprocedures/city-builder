**Steelhaven**

Steelhaven is a historic industrial district located within Kaelin City, the de facto capital of the socialist state of Azura. Established by Cassius Blackwood in 1882 as a steel manufacturing hub, Steelhaven has played a pivotal role in shaping the city's history and identity.

Geography and Infrastructure
---------------------------

Steelhaven occupies a 7.5 square kilometer area within Kaelin City, situated along the banks of the Kaelin River. The district is bounded by the infamous Blackstone Ridge to the north and the crumbling industrial complexes along the riverbank to the south. Steelhaven's infrastructure reflects its original purpose as an industrial center, with numerous factories, machinery yards, and a sprawling network of railways.

**History**

Steelhaven was founded on the site of a former wetland area, which Cassius Blackwood purchased in 1882. The district quickly became the hub of Kaelin City's steel industry, with massive steelworks and manufacturing facilities dominating the landscape. As the socialist revolution of Azura swept across the region, Steelhaven underwent significant transformation, becoming a symbol of state-directed socialism.

**The Fall of Steelhaven**

In the early 21st century, Steelhaven began to decline as Kaelin City's industrial base shifted towards more diversified and technologically advanced sectors. The district's fortunes continued to wane following the Great Blackwater Rebellion in 2022, which exposed widespread corruption and neglect within the city's municipal government. Many of Steelhaven's original factories and machinery yards were left abandoned or repurposed for other uses.

**Modern-Day Steelhaven**

Today, Steelhaven exists as a shadow of its former self, with many historic buildings having been reclaimed by nature. While some areas remain industrialized, others have transformed into artists' colonies, tech incubators, or alternative cultural spaces. The district's original purpose has given way to new uses, but remnants of its rich history and legacy remain.

**Notable Landmarks**

1. **Cassius Blackwood Statue**: An ornate equestrian statue of the industrialist founder, located in Steelhaven's town square.
2. **Blackstone Tower**: A former office building turned museum, showcasing Steelhaven's history as a steel manufacturing hub.
3. **The Furnace**: A historic power plant now repurposed as an art installation and concert venue.

**Decadence and Debauchery**

Steelhaven has long been associated with decadence and debauchery, reflecting the city's broader cultural trends. The district's abandoned factories, crumbling infrastructure, and history of neglect have created a unique atmosphere that fosters creative experimentation and alternative lifestyles.
