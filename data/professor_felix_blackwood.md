Early Life and Education

Blackwood was born on a remote, industrialized island on the eastern seaboard of North America, where his family had established a thriving agricultural business. However, as a young man, Blackwood became increasingly disillusioned with the social and environmental issues plaguing the city's declining economy. He pursued higher education in folklore, anthropology, and sociology at Tenebrous University, where he befriended Augusta LaRouche, a prominent musician and revolutionary.

Founding of the Folk Horror Collective

In 2005, Blackwood co-founded the first Folk Horror collective within Tenebrous, bringing together artists from various disciplines to create an immersive, avant-garde performance experience that drew upon local folklore, mythology, and industrial decay. The group's early performances took place in abandoned warehouses, rooftops, and underground caverns, drawing on Tenebrous's rich history of rebellion and counter-culture.

Artistic Collaborations

Blackwood has collaborated with numerous artists within the city's vibrant music scene, including Sonic Lab's experimental DJs, Raven's Peak-based hip-hop groups, and Carnaby Hollow-based spoken word poets. His work often incorporates themes of industrial decay, social upheaval, and environmental degradation, as well as mythological narratives and folkloric motifs.

Academic Career

In addition to his artistic pursuits, Blackwood has maintained an active academic career, publishing numerous papers on the intersection of folklore, sociology, and environmental studies in academic journals. His research focuses on the ways in which Tenebrous's unique cultural identity reflects its complex history of industrialization, urbanization, and social change.

Cult Phenomenon

As a result of his work with the Folk Horror collective, Blackwood has become an influential figure within Tenebrous's cult scene. His distinctive blend of avant-garde performance art, radical intellectualism, and mysticism has inspired countless fans and admirers throughout the city, who see him as a visionary guiding force in their quest for creative expression and social transformation.
