The Sump

The Sump is a residential district located in the southeastern quadrant of Tenebrous, characterized by narrow alleys and rundown tenements. The area has historically served as a magnet for migrant workers seeking to establish a new life amidst the city's sprawling industrial landscape.

Geography and Climate
------------------------

The Sump lies at the intersection of Raven's Peak and Carnaby Hollow, straddling the southernmost tip of the city's grid-like layout. The district is dominated by three parallel streets: Creeping Creek Road, Sour Lemon Alley, and Sewer Street. Weather patterns in the area are influenced by its coastal location, with fog rolling in from the ocean during most months of the year.

History
--------

The Sump was originally a rural area on the outskirts of Tenebrous, with small farms and agricultural fields serving as a primary food source for the city's residents. As the port city expanded and industrialized, the district became a destination for migrant workers seeking employment in the factories and shipyards that dotted the cityscape.

In the mid-20th century, the Sump underwent significant changes with the arrival of the Interstate Freeway System and the construction of new highways connecting Tenebrous to neighboring cities. This transformation led to increased suburbanization and the development of tenement housing, which remains a defining feature of the district's landscape today.
