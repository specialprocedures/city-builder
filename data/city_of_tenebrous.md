City of Tenebrous

Tenebrous is a sprawling metropolis located on the eastern seaboard of the Americas, characterized by a perpetual shroud of industrial decay and moral despair. This dystopian hub of urban decay has given birth to a unique blend of social and cultural norms that defy categorization.

Geography and Climate
------------------------

Tenebrous occupies a coastal site, where the once-vibrant port city was ravaged by environmental disasters and economic collapse. The streets are lined with crumbling tenements, and factories belch toxic fumes into the atmosphere, casting an eternal gloom over the cityscape. The climate is oppressive, with frequent fog banks rolling in from the ocean, creating a thick veil of mist that shrouds the city.

3. **Carnaby Hollow**: A derelict district once famous for its jazz clubs, now home to seedy underworld figures and hackers who inhabit the shadows of the web.

History
--------

Tenebrous has a complex and tumultuous history marked by revolution, violence, industrialization, decay, and environmental disaster. The once-thriving port city gave birth to various social and cultural groups but ultimately succumbed to economic decline and human neglect.

Throughout its long-standing struggle for survival, the people of Tenebrous have become adept at improvisation, finding creative outlets in whatever spaces are available â€“ underground raves, impromptu jazz sessions on street corners or secret graffiti battles. The city's unique blend of social and cultural norms has led to a distinct urban identity, shaped by the city's history and the resilience of its inhabitants.
